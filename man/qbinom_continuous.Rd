\title{Calculate the Maximum Estimated Defect Rate (Continuous Case)}
\usage{
qbinom_continuous(k, n, certainty)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{A numeric value representing the number of observed defects.
Need not be an integer. Must be non-negative.}

\item{n}{A numeric value representing the sample size. Need not be an integer.
Must be greater than 0.}

\item{certainty}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the desired
level of confidence (e.g., 0.95 for 95\% certainty).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the maximum estimated defect rate (p).
}
\description{
This function calculates the maximum estimated defect rate (p) for a population,
given a number of observed defects (k) in a sample of size (n). It is
equivalent to finding the upper bound of a one-sided confidence interval for a
binomial proportion.
}
\details{
The function finds the value of \code{p} that solves the equation:
P(X <= k | n, p) = 1 - certainty
where X follows a binomial distribution.
}
\examples{
# If we test 20 items and find 0 defects, what is the maximum defect
# rate we can state with 95\% certainty?
qbinom_continuous(k = 0, n = 20, certainty = 0.95)
# Expected output: ~0.139

# With 5 defects in a sample of 100, what's the upper bound of the
# defect rate with 95\% certainty?
qbinom_continuous(k = 5, n = 100, certainty = 0.95)
# Expected output: ~0.107
