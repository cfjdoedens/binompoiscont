\title{Poisson distribution, version continuous in both arguments}
\usage{
dpois_continuous(x, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the number of events that actually occur in a given interval of
time or space; x >= 0}

\item{lambda}{the number of events that on average occur in that given
interval; lambda >= 0}
}
\value{
The probability of x events occurring in the interval or space given
that lambda events occur on average
}
\description{
This is a continuous version of dpois(x, lambda).
In dpois(x, lambda) x is restricted to be a non negative integer;
lambda can be any non negative real number.
In dpois_continuous(x, lambda) both x and lambda can be any non negative
real number. So for dpois_continuous(x, lambda) x does not need to be an
integer, but can be 0 or any positive real number.

dpois(x, lambda) is the probability of x events occurring in the interval
or space given that lambda events occur on average in that interval or space.
How to interpret this when x is not a whole number?
So, how to interpret dpois_continuous(x, lambda) for non integer values of
x?

The problem I want to tackle with this continuous Poisson distribution is
to assess the probability of the result of n monetary unit samples drawn from
a monetary mass, given we know p, the total fraction of
errors of the monetary mass. We then take x to be the sum of the
fractions of monetary errors in the n samples.
So this explains a non integer x.

Lambda is given as n*p. Lambda is the average expected number of errors in the
n samples. So lambda is the expected value of x.

Mathematically we know that dpois(x, lambda) is the same as
lambda^x * exp(-lambda) / factorial(x).
When x is not an integer we can use the gamma function to calculate the
factorial(x) part of the formula. So we can use gamma(x + 1) instead of
factorial(x). This is because gamma(x + 1) = x!.
So, dpois(x, lambda) is the same as
lambda^x * exp(-lambda) / gamma(x + 1).
This we use below in the code for dpois_continuous().
